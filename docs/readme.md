# User Centric Frontend Development – Code Institute
This is a website showcasing the band known as “The Monkees”. On the site you will be able to find general information about the group, images, links to music and videos, upcoming tour dates as well as a form to submit messages to the band.

## UX

The website was designed with fans in mind who either want to access the bands media or get in touch with them. There isalso scope with being able to stay up to date with tour dates with links that would take them to the ticket sellers. 
If you wanted to find images, media, tour dates or even contact the band; all of this can be achieved with the top navigation. There are also links to the bands social media accounts so fans can keep up to date with them in other ways. 


## User story:

### Fan
Can listen to new tracks as well as find the links to social media

### Journalist
Would be able to see upcoming tour dates or new release and report on them.

### Curious
Someone who hasn’t heard of the band before can easily come to the page and find information about them as well as listen or watch them for the first time.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Features Left to Implement
•	Having an embedded video player as opposed to a media download
Technologies Used
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.6

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1.	Contact form:
i.	Go to the "Contact Us" page
ii.	Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
iii.	Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
iv.	Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


## Deployment

The site is currently deployed on GitHub Pages. To do this I pushed all the content (index page, media assets and style sheets). 


This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
•	Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
•	Different configuration files?
•	Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
